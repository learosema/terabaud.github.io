Hello! My name is Lea Rosema. I am a passionate digital artist based in Hamburg, Germany. 

At the age of 8, I started to learn coding with the [Schneider CPC 464](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) in [Locomotive BASIC](http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Locomotive_BASIC). At the age of 13, I switched to a 386 PC and further advanced my coding skills. I learned Turbo Pascal and x86 Assembly Language and created my first games and graphics demos using [mode 0x13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h). 

In the late 90's, I started playing with the web platform. Since then, I fell in love the web platform. I never used `<blink>` but a fair amount of `<marquee>` and started gaining backend skills with Perl CGI Scripting that turned out to be
replaced soon by PHP. 

In my day-to-day work in the mid 2000s, I gained a lot of experience in the [ASP.NET](https://asp.net/) stack. With the switch from ASP.NET to ASP.NET MVC in 2012, front end development came into play. 

Today, I focus on frontend development using [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com).

By night, I make digital arts using JavaScript. I love playing with the HTML5 Canvas, SVG, WebGL and exploring new JavaScript APIs for fun and profit.
