Hello! My name is Lea Rosema. I am a Full Stack Software Developer, currently based in Papenburg, Germany. 


At the age of 8, I started to learn coding with the Schneider CPC 464 in Locomotive BASIC. 

I love the web platform. As a life-long learner, I always keep up-to date with modern web technologies and love to work on projects
following agile and test-first development workflows.

For fun and profit, I enjoy creative coding on Codepen playing with HTML5 Canvas, SVG, WebGL and exploring new JavaScript APIs.
