Hello! My name is Lea Rosema. I am a Full Stack Software Developer, currently based in Papenburg, Germany. 

At the age of 8, I started to learn coding with the [Schneider CPC 464](https://cpcbox.com) in [Locomotive BASIC](http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Locomotive_BASIC). At the age of 13, I switched to a 386 PC, further advanced my coding skills. I learned Turbo Pascal and x86 Assembly Language and created my first games and graphics demos using [mode 0x13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h). In the late 90s I started playing with the web platform. 

Today I love the web platform. As a life-long learner, I always keep up-to date with modern web technologies and love to work on projects following agile and test-first development workflows.

For fun and profit, I enjoy creative coding on Codepen playing with HTML5 Canvas, SVG, WebGL and exploring new JavaScript APIs.
