Hello! My name is Lea Rosema. I am a passionate digital artist based in Hamburg, Germany. 

In my day-to-day work, I am working as a frontend developer at [SinnerSchrader](https://sinnerschrader.com).

By night, I create digital arts using JavaScript. I love playing with the HTML5 Canvas, SVG, WebGL and exploring new JavaScript APIs for fun and profit.

Check out my works on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/terabaud/).
