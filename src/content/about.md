Hello! My name is Lea Rosema. I am a passionate Full Stack Software Developer, currently based in Papenburg, Germany. 

At the age of 8, I started to learn coding with the [Schneider CPC 464](https://cpcbox.com) in [Locomotive BASIC](http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Locomotive_BASIC). At the age of 13, I switched to a 386 PC and further advanced my coding skills. I learned Turbo Pascal and x86 Assembly Language and created my first games and graphics demos using [mode 0x13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h). 

In the late 90's, I started playing with the web platform. Since then, I fell in love the web platform. I never used `<blink>` but a fair amount of `<marquee>` and started gaining backend skills with Perl CGI Scripting. Then, I switched from Perl to PHP/MySQL and ASP.NET/Microsoft SQL Server. Today, I focus on JavaScript in node.js and in the browser.

As a life-long learner, I always keep up-to date with modern web technologies and love to work on projects following agile and test-first development workflows.

I also enjoy creative coding and audio/graphics programming, playing with HTML5 Canvas, SVG, WebGL and exploring new JavaScript APIs for fun and profit. Check out my works on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/terabaud/).
